## 🛠️ About Playable.ai

[![Live Demo](https://img.shields.io/badge/Live%20Demo-playable-zora.netlify.app-brightgreen?style=for-the-badge)](https://playable-zora.netlify.app/)

**Playable.ai** is a **vibe-coding platform** that turns plain-English prompts into fully playable mini-arcade games—instantly. It's built for designers, hackers, streamers, and anyone who wants to ship fun, experimental games with zero code.

But Playable.ai isn't just about building—it's about owning.

Each game you create is **minted as its own GameCoin**—a unique ERC-20 token that unlocks access, funding, and monetisation the moment your game goes live.

### ✨ Key Features

- ⚡ **Prompt-to-Game Flow**: Describe a concept and Playable.ai auto-generates art, code, music, and deployment in seconds.
- 🪙 **GameCoins = Etherlink Tokens**: Every game launches with a dedicated token (e.g., $BLAST) that has built-in liquidity and creator royalties.
- 🔐 **Token-Gated Modes**: Use your GameCoin balance to unlock extra levels, cosmetic skins, or multiplayer lobbies.
- 🏆 **Reward Loops**: The most active players and top-score wallets receive automatic airdrops of GameCoin.
- 💸 **Built-in Monetisation**: Sell power-ups, crowdfund expansions, or run limited-time challenges—all paid in your game's token.
- 🔁 **Remixable Games**: Anyone can fork an existing Playable game, tweak the vibe, and launch a new coin that shares royalties upstream.

### 💡 Why Playable.ai?

While other no-code tools let you build, **Playable.ai lets you build and own**. GameCoins (minted on Etherlink) create sustainable, community-powered micro-arcades where:

- **Players fund the features they want** and earn for their engagement
- **Creators capture upside** from every play-through, remix, or token trade
- **Games grow virally** through on-chain incentives and remix culture

Launch a game, mint its coin, and watch your idea evolve into a living arcade economy—powered by Playable.ai.

### 🔗 Powered by Etherlink

We use the **GameTokenFactory** smart contracts deployed on Etherlink testnet to mint ERC-20 tokens for each game. This enables seamless, cost-effective token creation that feels native to the game creation flow.
