[![Live Demo](https://img.shields.io/badge/Live%20Demo-Playable.ai-brightgreen?style=for-the-badge&logo=game-controller)](https://playable-etherlink.netlify.app/)

**Playable.ai** is a **vibe-coding platform** that turns plain-English prompts into fully playable mini-arcade games—instantly. It's built for designers, hackers, streamers, and anyone who wants to ship fun, experimental games with zero code.

### 🔗 Smart Contracts (Etherlink Testnet)

- **GameTokenFactory**: [`0x53255c688F36a49599378F7A39237f54Ab6bb8A8`](https://testnet-explorer.etherlink.com/address/0x53255c688F36a49599378F7A39237f54Ab6bb8A8)
- **GameToken Template**: [`0x3bcA759bd3F7972Dca4120Ed262E44c59a111C96`](https://testnet-explorer.etherlink.com/address/0x3bcA759bd3F7972Dca4120Ed262E44c59a111C96)

But Playable.ai isn't just about building—it's about owning.

Each game you create is **minted as its own GameCoin**—a unique ERC-20 token that unlocks access, funding, and monetisation the moment your game goes live.

### ✨ Key Features

- ⚡ **Prompt-to-Game Flow**: Describe a concept and Playable.ai auto-generates art, code, music, and deployment in seconds.
- 🪙 **GameCoins = Etherlink Tokens**: Every game launches with a dedicated token (e.g., $BLAST) that has built-in liquidity and creator royalties.
- 🔐 **Token-Gated Modes**: Use your GameCoin balance to unlock extra levels, cosmetic skins, or multiplayer lobbies.
- 🏆 **Reward Loops**: The most active players and top-score wallets receive automatic airdrops of GameCoin.
- 💸 **Built-in Monetisation**: Sell power-ups, crowdfund expansions, or run limited-time challenges—all paid in your game's token.
- 🔁 **Remixable Games**: Anyone can fork an existing Playable game, tweak the vibe, and launch a new coin that shares royalties upstream.

### 💡 Why Playable.ai?

While other no-code tools let you build, **Playable.ai lets you build and own**. GameCoins (minted on Etherlink) create sustainable, community-powered micro-arcades where:

- **Players fund the features they want** and earn for their engagement
- **Creators capture upside** from every play-through, remix, or token trade
- **Games grow virally** through on-chain incentives and remix culture

Launch a game, mint its coin, and watch your idea evolve into a living arcade economy—powered by Playable.ai.
